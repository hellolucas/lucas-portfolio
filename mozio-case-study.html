</div>

<div class="abstract">
	<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
		<p>I worked remotely with Mozio for over 1 year.</p>

		<p>Mozio is a Search & Compare app that lets you find all types of ground
		transportation, and book the one that makes the most sense for your wallet
		and schedule.</p>

		<p>During this time, I helped redesign their website user experience and interface.
			This lead to an increase in booking conversions by 90%+ over a 3-month period after launch.</p>

		<p>In parallel, we designed and developed their iOS and Android apps from concept
			to launch, within 6 months, with an average rating of 4 stars.</p>

		<p>A WYSIWYG whitelabel creation tool was also developed. This helped close
			Travel & Hotel partnerships faster, free developer resources, and improved
			setup time from ~3.5 hours to ~10 minutes.</p>

	 		<span class="subtitle">Mozio believe the travel experience should be simple
				and enjoyable. They place the user experience above all else.</span>
	 	</div>

	<h2 id="ar1-goals">GOALS</h2>

	<p>Mozio wanted to improve booking conversions and increase the types of use
		cases they could serve. They decided to re-design the user experience and
		interface of the main website.</p>

	<p>They also wanted to increase their direct bookings with users; so they began
		to design and develop an iOS and Android app that could get them closer to travelers.</p>

	<h2 id="ar1-role">MY ROLE</h2>
	<p>I first joined Mozio as an UX/UI designer, making up a 2-man team together
		with my Lead Designer. My role was focused on:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Understanding our users</li>
		<li>Developing use cases</li>
		<li>Shaping them into user flows</li>
		<li>Wireframes</li>
		<li>Prototypes</li>
		<li>...and finding different solutions for new features</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Because it was such a small team, my role was fluid, and would adapt with
		the work at hand. This included interface design and some front-end coding.</p>

	<p>Over the course of 1 year, this role evolved from support to overseeing Mozio’s
		website redesign and other internal tools.</p>

	<h1 id="ar1-website">REDESIGNING AN EXISTING WEBSITE</h1>

	  <source src="img/mozio/web-app-hd.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video>
</div>

	<h2 id="ar1-start-1">GETTING STARTED</h2>

	<p>The lead designer had already started with the design of a new user interface
		(UI), and there was already several well understood use cases with feedback
		to work with.
</p>

	<p>I began by reviewing use cases to improve and collaborating with the new
		UI design.
</p>

	<p>Over time we formalised our users into personas. This meant we could prioritise
		which features to design first, based on how well they helped the users
		achieve their goals.</p>

	<p>In turn, this meant we could ensure a design that would improve conversions.
</p>

		<div class="image-block">
			<img class="post-image" src="img/mozio/personas.png" alt="Mozio user personas">
			<span class="subtitle">User personas (simplified)</span>
		</div>

	<h2 id="ar1-research">USING USER FEEDBACK TO IMPROVE USE CASES</h2>

	<p>Research and insights about our users often came from the Customer Support,
		Sales and Partnership teams. They were in a position to identify problems and
		opportunities, with:
</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Complaint analysis (Customer support and Review websites)</li>
		<li>Email surveys on Post-purchase</li>
		<li>In-depth interviews</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This was put together with further research:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Qualitative questionnaires</li>
		<li>Booking flow through Google analytics</li>
		<li>Prototype usability testing</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Because research was not exclusive to designers, this meant some advantages:
		We could understand our users faster and cheaper, in a greater range of use
		cases, and in real situations.
</p>

<p><blockquote>When it came to improving Mozio bookings and making a better product
	for our users, this available research became our single most important asset.</blockquote></p>


		<p>Some of the user issues found included:
</p>

<div class="issue-list">
	<div class="issue-wrapper">
		<img class="column-1 issue-avatar" src="img/mozio/price.svg" alt="unclear pricing"></img>
		<div class="column-2">
			<span class="issue-title">Unclear pricing & Ride time</span>
			<span class="issue-body">Search results did not show ride time and if price
				was per person or per group. Users had a hard time deciding which ride to take.
</span>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="issue-wrapper">
		<img class="column-1 issue-avatar" src="img/mozio/time.svg" alt="pickup time confusion"></img>
		<div class="column-2">
			<span class="issue-title">Confusion about pickup times</span>
			<span class="issue-body">When booking To/From airport rides, users would suddenly realise they didn’t know what were the appropriate times for pickup.

			</span>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="issue-wrapper">
		<img class="column-1 issue-avatar" src="img/mozio/driver.svg" alt="Driver realiability"></img>
		<div class="column-2">
			<span class="issue-title">Uncertainty about driver reliability</span>
			<span class="issue-body">Because there were not enough assurances, first time users would be uncertain if the driver was going to arrive on time.
</span>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

	<p>Having a clear view of our users and their issues, we could prioritise which features to design. Together with the product managers, these were laid out in a task complexity vs. business/user impact:
</p>

		<div class="image-block no-shadow">
			<img  class="post-image" src="img/mozio/execution-impact.svg" alt="Complexity of execution vs. User impact">
			<span class="subtitle"></span>
		</div>

	<p>Many of these features and more were designed for, resulting in several
		improvements that made easier for users to book rides in Mozio’s website.</p>


	<h2 id="ar1-ui">REDESIGNING THE UI: CHANGING TO MOZIO 2.0</h2>

	<p>Redesigning Mozio&rsquo;s website UI was an incremental process.</p>

	<p>We split the design mockups into components that could be assigned to individual developers.
</p>

	<p>This was done so the designs could be reusable and put together in a React.js component library. This meant future development would be easier, faster and cheaper.
</p>

	<div class="image-block">
		<img class="post-image" src="img/mozio/component-card.png" alt="Mozio UI components">
		<span class="subtitle">UI components: Result cards</span>
	</div>

	<div class="image-block">

	</div>

		<img class="post-image" src="img/mozio/notification.png" alt="Mozio UI components">
		<span class="subtitle">UI components: Inline notifications</span>
	</div>


	<p>I progressively adapted the new UI to all Mozio pages, designing new components and solutions where needed.
</p>

			<img  class="post-image" src="img/mozio/schedule.png" alt="Schedule and Class selection for National Express">
			<span class="subtitle">Schedule & class selector — Iteration 1 of 4</span>
		</div>

	<h2 id="ar1-agile">WORKING AGILE: OVERSEEING DESIGN-TO-DEVELOPMENT</h2>

	<p>Being an UX/UI designer in a company where most co-workers are developers
		means being able to speak both 'designer' & 'developer' languages. </p>

	<p>Product managers assigned features and UI components to developers,
		and I would review and support their implementation. </p>

	<p>This included: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Styleguide specifications with sizes, colors, states, etc</li>
		<li>Documentation describing how UI components behaved to user interaction</li>
		<li>Providing solutions to unexpected use cases</li>
		<li>Adapting the design because of time or tech limitations</li>
		<li>Providing icons and visual assets</li>
		<li>Video mockups that could show how the app “moved”</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="image-block no-shadow">
		<img  class="post-image" src="img/mozio/spec-example.svg" alt="Specification sheets">
		<span class="subtitle">Component guidelines for developers</span>
	</div>

	<p>Video mockups were used to showcase interaction examples. </p>

	<div class="image-block">
		<video autoplay loop muted>
		  <source src="img/mozio/roundtrip-clean.mp4" type="video/mp4" alt="Mozio booking trip upsell animation">
		</video>
		<span class="subtitle">Roundtrip upsell (via After Effects)</span>
	</div>


	<h2 id="ar1-outcome">THE OUTCOME</h2>

	<p>Mozio platform increased it's booking conversions by <span style="font-weight: bold;">~90% over a period of 3 months.</span>
</p>

	<p>It also achieved:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A complete interface redesign</li>
		<li>A reusable front-end component library to be used for faster development</li>
		<li>Vastly improved how it handled use cases</li>
		<li>A base from which to begin designing for new use cases: train & bus bookings, hourly rides, schedule selection, etc</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Mozio went on to successfully close a new Series B round.</p>

	<h1 id="ar1-internal">WORKING INTERNAL PROJECTS</h1>

	<p>Improvements were also done internally.</p>

	<p>Mozio also operates by integrating their booking tool with Travel and Hotel
		booking websites, so these can upsell transportation services.
</p>

	<p>This is done with Mozio whitelabels that can be styled to be similar to the
		brand of each new partnership.
</p>

		<div class="image-block">
			<img  class="post-image" src="img/mozio/whitelabel.jpg" alt="Mozio Whitelabels">
			<span class="subtitle">How Whitelabel will look like for Mozio partners</span>
		</div>

	<p>This required both designers and developers. This meant that sales & partnership
		teams would often have to wait for availability, making it more difficult to
		 pitch for potential clients.
</p>

	<p>Also, developers or designers could not focus with Mozio’s main products. In
		total, the whitelabels required an average of 3.5~ hours to go live.
</p>

<h2>DESIGNING A NEW TOOL</h2>


	<p>Tasked with the design of an internal tool that could improve this,
		I began by interviewing our departments on how they worked and how we could
		make it easier for them.
</p>

	<p>Together with the Product owner, a tool was devised that would allow the sales
		teams to create and publish whitelabels by changing 5 different parameters.
</p>

		<div class="image-block">
			<img  class="post-image" src="img/mozio/whitelabel-tool.jpg" alt="Whitelabel creation tool">
			<span class="subtitle">Whitelabel tool dashboard</span>
		</div>

	<p>This improved Whitelabel creation times from ~3.5 hours to ~10 minutes/each
		and free&rsquo;d valuable developer &amp; designer resources.</p>

	<h1 id="ar1-mobile">DESIGNING A MOBILE APP FROM THE GROUND UP</h1>

	<h2 id="ar1-start-2">GETTING STARTED</h2>

	<p>For the mobile app, my role was developing the user experience. I
		helped define use cases, design user flows for the use cases and make sure
		we provided a smooth user experience.
</p>

	<p>We began to discuss the use cases we could design for. Some of these included:
</p>

		<div class="issue-list">
			<div class="issue-wrapper">
				<img class="column-1 issue-avatar" src="img/mozio/cross.svg" alt="Cross Web-Mobile Reservation Management"></img>
				<div class="column-2">
					<span class="issue-title">Cross Web-Mobile Reservation Management</span>
					<span class="issue-body">Allow the users to manage their reservations
						across platforms and have access to a single account</span>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="issue-wrapper">
				<img class="column-1 issue-avatar" src="img/mozio/train.svg" alt="Train Bookings"></img>
				<div class="column-2">
					<span class="issue-title">Train & Tram Bookings</span>
					<span class="issue-body">Allow the users to book rides with different
						train systems — timed vs open rides, start/end stop, etc.</span>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="issue-wrapper">
				<img class="column-1 issue-avatar" src="img/mozio/destination.svg" alt="Destination/No Destination Use Cases"></img>
				<div class="column-2">
					<span class="issue-title">Destination/No Destination Use Cases</span>
					<span class="issue-body">Allow the user to book car rides without a
						destination set</span>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

	<p>The launch of App could be broken down into 3 phases :</p>

	<ol>
		<li>A tool for Mozio customers to manage their bookings</li>
		<li>Add on-demand and scheduled rides booking capabilities</li>
		<li>Add Airport express line booking &mdash;&nbsp;focus on Heathrow Express
			(London, UK) and SEPTA (Philadelphia, US)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>This made for quicker release cycles, and allowed immediate testing. We began to
		design for iOS first, and later adapted for Android.
</p>

	<h2 id="ar1-flow">USE CASES TO USER FLOWS: MOVING TO MOBILE</h2>

	<p>While the booking funnel was essentially the same, what the user needs and
		expects from his mobile apps is very different.
</p>

	<p>We began by adapting Mozio’s website user flows to the mobile experience and creating new ones specific to mobile:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Onboarding</li>
		<li>Sign in/sign up</li>
		<li>Booking On-Demand rides (with & without destination)</li>
		<li>Choosing pick-up schedule</li>
		<li>Booking for the Airport express line</li>
		<li>etc...</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="image-block rotate">
		  <img class="bottom post-image" src="img/mozio/user-flow-1.svg" alt="Bus & Train mobile user flows"/>
		  <img class="top post-image" src="img/mozio/user-flow-2.svg" alt="Sign In/Sign Up mobile user flows"/>
		<span class="subtitle">User flows examples — Bus & Train conditional, Sign in/Sign up</span>
	</div>

	<p>To make sure the website-to-mobile experience was seamless, a lot of focus was placed in getting the onboarding experience and reservation management right.
</p>

	<h2 id="ar1-wireframe">DESIGNING WIREFRAMES</h2>

	<p>With the user flows approved, we could begin designing the wireframes to start visualising the app. Developers also began building the environment and logic.
</p>

		<div class="image-block">
			<img class="post-image" src="img/mozio/wire-map.jpg" alt="Wireframe user flow maps">
			<span class="subtitle">On-Demand to Pre-booked: Selecting time and day of ride</span>
		</div>

	<p>The wireframes helped us improve the user flows, in a back-and-forth process.
</p>

	<p>During this time, our lead designer explored visual styles for the mobile app
		— how it could look like.
</p>

	<h2 id="ar1-mockup">TURNING WIREFRAMES INTO MOCKUPS</h2>

	<p>With the visual style approved, UI design began. The design was iterative
		and done in parallel to user flow, wireframing and development.
</p>

	<p><blockquote>Working tasks & projects in parallel sprints was a common theme.
		We had to make developers would not be waiting for design, so nobody would be
		a bottleneck.
</blockquote></p>

	<p>As mockups were finalised, we began testing for their usability and affordance.
</p>

	<p>We did this by creating fast prototypes with InVision/Proto.io and running
		usability tests with Mozio co-workers, as well as on the streets of San Francisco.
</p>

	<p>This would give the feedback we needed to continously improve the design.</p>

	<p style="text-align:center;">&mdash;</p>

	<p>The last use case we designed for before launch was for ‘ticketing purchase in the SEPTA airport line’, Philadelphia's public transit service.
</p>

		<div class="image-block">
			<img  class="post-image" src="img/mozio/septa-screen.png" alt="SEPTA Mozio ticketing app">
		</div>

	<p>Mozio&rsquo;s mobile app launch happened first in Philadelphia, US, a week
		before the NFL Drafts of April 2017. </p>

	<p>The app acquired ~19,000 users in 2 days, with an average rating of 4.7 stars in the iOS app store for the first months.
</p>

	<p>You can visit Mozio here, and download the mobile app here:
		<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mozio/id1103373539?mt=8">iOS</a> or
		<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mozio.android&hl=en">Android</a>.</p>

	<h1 id="ar1-closing">CLOSING THOUGHTS</h1>

	<p>Mozio was a fast-paced startup environment. Working remotely was pragmatic and based on result delivered. It meant working in many different roles, with all teams.
</p>

	<p>Over 1 year, I had the chance to research and design multiple features and cross-platform projects to conclusion, and see Mozio grow and double their daily revenue.
</p>

	<p>The design process was iterative and constantly moved back-and-forth, and I would jump back to different stages at any given time. Because of the new challenges every day, this case study is only a superficial explanation of all the work done.
